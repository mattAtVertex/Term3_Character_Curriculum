# Understanding The Structure Of The Head Lesson Plan

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The goal here is to understand the face from both an anatomical and a structural perspective. The lectures will break down the anatomy and specific elements you need to pay attention to you. However, the demonstration will focus on re-creating this through structure, volume, and planes.</p>
<p>Make sure to follow each lecture as closely as you can. I cannot stress how important Process is here. This is a perfect example of how it is important to <strong>go slow in order to go fast.</strong></p>
<p>Rushing over these videos and pushing through this to fast is Akin to rushing through an all expense paid trip at the shopping mall and grabbing only a few thingsâ€¦ soak it in. These lessons have been learned over nearly 30 years of sculpting.</p>
