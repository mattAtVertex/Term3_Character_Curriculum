# Seven Rules Of Figure Construction

<div>
<p>Help you in your construction, I’ve created a few rules to figure sculpting. These rules have been developed over thousands of years. I didn’t come up with them. They were passed down to me by my teachers as I am passing them down to you. You have helped me become a better artist and they will do the same for you.</p>

<p>This rule is designed to help you makes sense. The complexity of the human body. This year totality of it is overwhelming when you begin. Your first and most important task is to learn how to see it simply the way a master Sculptor does. Remember, mastery is not magic. It’s a process. Part of that process is learning how to think and see the way Master is due. Masters see everything in front of them in the simplest possible way and they have a hierarchy a form that enables that. Will look at that in a bit.</p>

<p>This is really just one of the rules of evolution much like the law of gravity.&nbsp; Nature just has it's own way. The forms of your arm mirror the forms of your leg. The forms of your hands mirror the forms of your feet. We can even expand this concept to see that almost all parts of the human body can be represented by circles, cylinders, boxes. They’re all more similar to each other than you might think.</p>

<p>The human body is built on principle of dynamic equilibrium. What this means is that no part of our body is static or built to stand perfectly still. Try modeling for a friend and you’ll see how hard that is. Our body is designed for motion. Either toward something or away from something.</p>

<p>One of the most important rules that beginners struggle with is the rule of convexity. Organic forms are almost always bursting with life. This means that all of their surfaces will be pushing out instead of collapsing into concavities. This is also an essential trick for creating something that looks a life. Surfaces that are flat or hollow generally tend to look like they’re dead.</p>

<p>This might seem to contradict what I just said about convexity but it’s important to make sure that when you have large movements you counterpose them with moments of rest. Just like a piece of music that reaches a crescendo and then drops down into a whisper. Eduard Lanteri shows this in the biceps really well and it’s a lesson that the sculptures of the renaissance knew well.</p>

<p>The rule of overlap simply states that everything is overlapping something. All muscles are overlapping or wrapping behind some bone; all fat pads are overlapping muscles and different layers of skin. This is a furthering of the hierarchy of form and making sure that you understand that the body is operating on many levels and many layers.</p>

<p>There are lines and curves running throughout your body. These lines simplify and organize your anatomy and when you learn them you can use them as construction tools. One of the most beautiful lines in the leg is how the sartorius wraps around from the outside of the leg towards the inside of the thigh and then rolls behind the knee to emerge as the line of the tibia that comes all the way down to the ankle.</p>
