# Step-By-Step Sculpting Demo I Lesson Plan

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p><span>The objective of this exercise is to develop an understanding of the anatomy, structure, volume, and plains of the torso. We will look at muscles and bones but almost always convert that information into structural elements that we have to re-create in 3-D.</span></p>
<p><span>Note, just as in the face lectures, process is important. Each step builds on the step prior. Please donâ€™t rush. Please give yourself the time to process this.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, you will not often be sculpting a body from scratch like this. You will pretty much always have a base mesh to sculpt as in the previous exercise. However, sculpting is a foundational skill and having this capacity is going to allow you to win friends and influence people. :-)</span></p>
