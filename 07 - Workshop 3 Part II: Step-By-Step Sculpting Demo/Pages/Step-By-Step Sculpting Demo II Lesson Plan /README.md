# Step-By-Step Sculpting Demo II Lesson Plan 

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p><span>In this module the goal is to learn the structure and the similarities of the arms and the legs. As before, we will identify the anatomical masses and landmarks and then translate that into three dimensional form that is required for us to sculpt as character folks.</span></p>
<p><span>Reminders, processes power. Pay attention to each step I make.</span></p>
<p><span>If your work doesn’t look like my work then you’ll want to trace it back to the decision you made where things diverged. This is an exercise that benefits through the Act of deep practice.</span></p>
<p><span>The key element of deep practice is repetition but… Not for The sake of mileage. Mileage doesn’t matter if you’re going the wrong way. In fact it makes things even more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you want to repeat The exercise making sure to stop when you notice a problem… Identify the point at which you got lost and then start over.</span><br><span>Good luck</span></p>
